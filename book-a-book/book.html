    <div class="book">
        <p><img src="images/image2.jpg" ><center>Seven lectures by the brilliant theoretical physicist have been compiled into this book to try to explain to the common man, the complex problems of mathematics and the question that has been gripped everyone all for centuries, the theory of existence. Undeniably intelligent, witty and childlike in his explanations, the narrator describes every detail about the beginning of the universe. He describes what a theory that can state the initiation of everything would encompass. Ideologies about the universe by Aristotle, Augustine, Hubble, Newton and Einstein have all been briefly introduced to the reader. Black holes and Big Bang has been explained in an unsophisticated manner for anyone to understand. All these events and individual theories may be strung together to create a theory of the origin of everything and the author strongly believes that the origin might not necessarily be from a singular event. He advocates the idea of a multi-dimensional origin with a no-boundary condition to remain true to the theories of modern physics and quantum physics. The book provides a clear view of the world through Stephenâ€™s mind where he respectfully dismisses the belief that the Universe conforms by a supernatural and all-powerful entity. About the Author Stephen Hawking: An English cosmologist, theoretical physicist, author as well as the Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology under the University of Cambridge, Stephen Hawking is a scholar with more than a dozen of honorary degrees. In was in 1963 that Stephen Hawking contracted a rare motor neuron disorder which gave him just two years to live, yet he went to Cambridge to become what he is today. <a href="#">CLICK HERE FOR INDEX</a>

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="images/author.webp" ><left><span>Stephen William Hawking</span> (8 January 1942 - 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.Hawking had a rare early-onset, slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (MND; also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects the motor neurones in the brain and spinal cord, which gradually paralysed him over decades. But disabilities didn't defied his talent.</left>
